This is a frontend-only project (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) deployed on Netlify, where the contact form uses a mock backend API route deployed on Vercel for testing purposes. The form submits data to the Vercel-hosted mock API endpoint (/api/contact) to simulate backend integration and validate form functionality without a full backend setup.
